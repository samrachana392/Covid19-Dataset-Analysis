# COVID-19 Data Analysis 

This project performs exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 data using **Python** and popular data analysis libraries.  
The purpose of this project is to practice data cleaning, grouping, filtering, and sorting techniques on a real-world dataset.



## Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  



##  Dataset

The dataset contains COVID-19 statistics for different countries and regions, including:
- Confirmed cases  
- Deaths  
- Recovered cases  



##  Analysis Performed

- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked for missing (null) values
- Grouped data by **Country/Region**
- Identified regions with:
  - Highest confirmed cases
  - Lowest death counts
- Filtered records with confirmed cases less than 100
- Sorted data based on:
  - Confirmed cases (ascending)
  - Recovered cases (descending)
- Performed country-specific analysis (Nepal)
